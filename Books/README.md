## Statistics for beginners
If you are very noop at statistics you should start with these series of books and videos and it doesn't contain heavy math, and it's good for a start.

* [Statistics, 4th Edition](http://bookzz.org/dl/2041032/739f82)
* [Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data](http://bookzz.org/dl/2042766/0e12ad)
* [Statistics For Dummies](http://bookzz.org/dl/635770/f11caa)

I consider this book between beginners and non-beginners but it's easy and you can learn statistics with application for engineering
